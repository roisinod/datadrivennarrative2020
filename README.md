# datadrivennarrative2020
Assignment for DH2002:Digital Tools and Methodologies II  
Since the 2000s, cancer progression in Ireland has halted. 
There has been a decline in areas such as hospital beds and trust in the Irish healthcare system. 
The research question that will be concentrated on in this data-driven narrative is why this is the case according to relevant data and visualisations.  
Hopefully, this piece of data journalism will give insight and awareness into the research question:  
Is there a halt in hospital progression? And could this be a contributing factor to the suffering of cancer patients?  
Irish and worldwide cancer and hospital data will be correlated. Possible causations will be explored through interactive visualisations. 
These interactive visualisations were produced using the programming language Python and the module Plotly Python library. 
The full code and larger visualisations can be seen at https://github.com/roisinod and the related GitHub pages.
